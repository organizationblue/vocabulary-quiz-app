# vocabulary-quiz-documentation

## MVP-plan
- The project is meant to help users improve on vocabulary between two languages they select.

### Main features
1.  As a user I want to be able to start vocabulary training so I can improve on English to Finnish translation and vice versa.
2.  As a user I want to be able to see an English word and select the correct corresponding Finnish word and vice versa.
3.  As a user I want immediate feedback on my answer, so I know if I answered correctly.
4. As a user I want to be able to see my score at the end of the session so I can track my progress.
